It is the default in newer versions.\nTo be safe against older scipy versions, we can use `method='simplex'` or `method='interior-point'` if highs fails, or just not specify it and let `linprog` choose the best default!\nActually, `linprog` without `method` uses `highs` by default on recent versions, and `interior-point` on older ones. It's safer to just omit `method='highs'` so it doesn't crash on old scipy!\n```python\n    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, bounds=bounds)\n```\nWait, scipy's old `interior-point` could be a bit inaccurate or slow, but for 26 variables and 325 constraints it takes a few milliseconds regardless. I will omit `method='highs'` to ensure broad compatibility.\n\nLet's double check if bounds could be negative.\n`bnd = min(x, y, 1-x, 1-y)`. `x,y` could be out of bounds if my candidate generation puts them outside $[0, 1]$.\nBut I do `centers = np.clip(centers, 0.001, 0.999)` before passing to `compute_radii`.\nSo `bnd` is at least 0.001.
