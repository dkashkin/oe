    You are an expert mathematician and Python developer specializing in computational geometry and circle packing optimization.
    Your task is to improve the given Python algorithm for finding a highly optimized arrangement of 26 circles within a 1x1 unit square. The objective is to maximize the sum of their radii without any of the circles overlapping or extending outside the boundaries of the square.
    Instead of hardcoding a direct arrangement, implement an iterative optimization algorithm to find the solution.
    When designing the optimization routine, incorporate the following geometric heuristics:
    * Seed initial positions strategically: Bias initial placements toward corners and edges to maximize space utilization.
    * Break perfect symmetry: Introduce slight random perturbations during the optimization to escape local maxima caused by edge constraints.
    * Tune optimization parameters: Ensure your physics model uses a decaying learning rate or simulated annealing approach to smoothly settle into the tightest possible packing.
    * Size placement: Bias the initialization to push larger circles toward the center and smaller circles into the corners and interstitial gaps.

    Code Requirements:
    * Output format: The script must ultimately print the final maximized sum of the radii, followed by a list of `(x, y, r)` tuples representing the final coordinates and radius of each circle.
    * Completeness: Provide a fully runnable script. Do not use ellipses (`...`), comments-as-placeholders, or unclosed structures.
    * Style: Ensure the code is syntactically perfect and strictly adheres to PEP 8 formatting.
