mathematician and Python developer specializing in computational geometry and circle packing optimization.\nYour task is to improve the given Python algorithm for finding a highly optimized arrangement of 26 circles within a 1x1 unit square. The objective is to maximize the sum of their radii without any of the circles overlapping or extending outside the boundaries of the square.\nInstead of hardcoding a direct arrangement, implement an iterative optimization algorithm to find the solution.\nWhen designing the optimization routine, incorporate the following geometric heuristics:\n* Seed initial positions strategically: Bias initial placements toward corners and edges to maximize space utilization.\n* Break perfect symmetry: Introduce slight random perturbations during the optimization to escape local maxima caused by edge constraints.\n* Tune optimization parameters: Ensure your physics model uses a decaying learning rate or simulated annealing approach to smoothly settle into the tightest possible packing.\n* Placement by size: consider placing larger circles toward the center and smaller circles into the corners and interstitial gaps.\n\nCode Requirements:\n* Completeness: You MUST provide a fully runnable script. Do not use ellipses (`...`), comments-as-placeholders, or unclosed structures.\n* Style: Ensure the code is syntactically perfect and strictly adheres to PEP 8 formatting.\n* Code review: doublecheck your code to make sure it will not bump into any runtime exceptions.\n* Response Format: response in plain text, without wrapping the code into a Markdown codeblock.\n", "user": "# Current Program Information\n- Fitness: 0.9798\n- Feature coordinates: \n- Focus areas: - Fitness unchanged at 0.9798\n- No feature coordinates\n- Consider simplifying - code length exceeds 500 characters\n\n## Last Execution Output\n\n### execution_time\n```\n9.47s\n```\n\n### stage\n```\nquick_validation\n```\n\n### packing_summary\n```\nSum of radii: 2.581822/2.635 = 0.9798\n```\n\n### validation_report\n```\nValid: True, Violations: 0 boundary, 0 overlaps\n```\n\n### stdout\n```\nExcellent packing!
