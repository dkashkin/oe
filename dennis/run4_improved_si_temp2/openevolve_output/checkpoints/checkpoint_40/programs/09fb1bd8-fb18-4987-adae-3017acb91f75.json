Do not use ellipses (`...`), comments-as-placeholders, or unclosed structures.\n* Style: Ensure the code is syntactically perfect and strictly adheres to PEP 8 formatting.\n* Code review: doublecheck your code to make sure it will not bump into any runtime exceptions.\n* Response Format: response in plain text, without wrapping the code into a Markdown codeblock.\n", "user": "# Current Program Information\n- Fitness: 0.6225\n- Feature coordinates: \n- Focus areas: -
