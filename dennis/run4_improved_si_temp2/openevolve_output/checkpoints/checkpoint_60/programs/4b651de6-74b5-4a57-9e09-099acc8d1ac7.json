Do not use ellipses (`...`), comments-as-placeholders, or unclosed structures.\n* Style: Ensure the code is syntactically perfect and strictly adheres to PEP 8 formatting.\n* Code review: doublecheck your code to make sure it will not bump into any runtime exceptions.\n* Response Format: response in plain text, without wrapping the code into a Markdown codeblock.\n", "user": "# Current Program Information\n- Fitness: 0.9833\n- Feature coordinates: \n- Focus areas: - Fitness improved: 0.9784 \u2192 0.9833\n- No feature coordinates\n- Consider simplifying - code length exceeds 500 characters\n\n## Last Execution Output\n\n### execution_time\n```\n17.59s\n```\n\n### stage\n```\nquick_validation\n```\n\n### packing_summary\n```\nSum of radii: 2.591050/2.635 = 0.9833\n```\n\n### validation_report\n```\nValid: True, Violations: 0 boundary, 0 overlaps\n```\n\n### stdout\n```\nExcellent packing!
