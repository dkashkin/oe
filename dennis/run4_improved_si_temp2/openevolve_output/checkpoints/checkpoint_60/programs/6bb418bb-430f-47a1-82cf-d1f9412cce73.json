The objective is to maximize the sum of their radii without any of the circles overlapping or extending outside the boundaries of the square.\nInstead of hardcoding a direct arrangement, implement an iterative optimization algorithm to find the solution.\nWhen designing the optimization routine, incorporate the following geometric heuristics:\n* Seed initial positions strategically: Bias initial placements toward corners and edges to maximize space utilization.\n* Break perfect symmetry: Introduce slight random perturbations during the optimization to escape local maxima caused by edge constraints.\n* Tune optimization parameters: Ensure your physics model uses a decaying learning rate or simulated annealing approach to smoothly settle into the tightest possible packing.\n* Placement by size: consider placing larger circles toward the center and smaller circles into the corners and interstitial gaps.\n\nCode Requirements:\n* Completeness: You MUST provide a fully runnable script. Do not use ellipses (`...`), comments-as-placeholders, or unclosed structures.\n* Style: Ensure the code is syntactically perfect and strictly adheres to PEP 8 formatting.\n* Code review: doublecheck your code to make sure it will not bump into any runtime exceptions.\n* Response Format: response in plain text, without wrapping the code into a Markdown codeblock.\n", "user": "# Current Program Information\n- Fitness: 0.3642\n- Feature coordinates: \n- Focus areas: - Fitness unchanged at 0.3642\n- No feature coordinates\n- Consider simplifying - code length exceeds 500 characters\n\n\n\n# Program Evolution History\n## Previous Attempts\n\n### Attempt 1\n- Changes: Unknown changes\n- Metrics: validity: 1.0000, sum_radii: 0.9598, target_ratio: 0.3642, combined_score: 0.3642, radius_variance: 0.0266, spatial_spread: 0.2381\n- Outcome: Improvement in all metrics\n\n## Top Performing Programs\n\n### Program 1 (Score: 0.3642)\n```python\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START\n\"\"\"Constructor-based circle packing for n=26 circles\"\"\"\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef construct_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Construct a specific arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square\n    that attempts to maximize the sum of their radii.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple of (centers, radii, sum_of_radii)\n        centers: np.array of shape (26, 2) with (x, y) coordinates\n        radii: np.array of shape (26) with radius of each circle\n        sum_of_radii: Sum of all radii\n    \"\"\"\n    #
