To find the optimal packing of 26 non-overlapping circles that maximizes the sum of their radii, we can formulate this as a continuous optimization problem using a simulated physics model with momentum.\n\nInstead of hardcoding positions, the circles start with strategically biased random initial positions and iteratively \"grow\" while repelling one another. This acts as a Penalty Method (or Augmented Lagrangian) algorithm, effectively finding the maximum possible sum of radii without overlapping.\n\n### Key Improvements Implemented:\n1. **Strategic Seed Initialization**: Multiple random restarts are employed. We selectively seed configurations strongly favoring corners and edges to maximize bounding box utilization.\n2. **Size Placement Bias**: The initial radii are mathematically parameterized based on their distance from the `[0.5, 0.5]` centroid\u2014biasing larger circles toward the center and letting small circles fill the corners. \n3. **Physics Optimization & Simulated Annealing**: We iterate using momentum gradients, a decaying learning rate, and an exponentially increasing constraint weight (`W`). This allows circles to easily swap positions early in the simulation before smoothly settling into a rigorous non-overlapping tight packing.\n4. **Symmetry Breaking**: We systematically introduce slight micro-perturbations (`np.random.randn`) during the early epochs to break symmetries and prevent the circles from stalling in unstable equilibrium local maxima.\n5. **Strict Overlap Resolution**: At the end of every simulation, an iterative rigid-scaling resolution is applied to ensure the solution is mathematically sound (preventing any floating-point violations).\n\n```python\n# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef construct_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Construct an optimized arrangement of 26 circles in a unit square\n    to maximize the sum of their radii using a physics-based relaxation algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 26\n    best_sum = 0\n    best_centers = None\n    best_radii = None\n    \n    np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility\n    \n    # 12 restarts with different initializations to traverse multiple topographies\n    for attempt in range(12):\n        # 1.
