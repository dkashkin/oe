The objective is to maximize the sum of their radii without any of the circles overlapping or extending outside the boundaries of the square.\nInstead of hardcoding a direct arrangement, implement an iterative optimization algorithm to find the solution.\nWhen designing the optimization routine, incorporate the following best practices:\n* Seed initial positions strategically: Bias initial placements toward corners and edges to maximize space utilization.\n* Break perfect symmetry: Introduce slight random perturbations during the optimization to escape local maxima caused by edge constraints.\n* Tune optimization parameters: Ensure your physics model uses a decaying learning rate or simulated annealing approach to smoothly settle into the tightest possible packing.\n* Size placement: Bias the initialization to push larger circles toward the center and smaller circles into the corners and interstitial gaps.\n* You MUST think creatively, identify multiple alternative options of the algorithm design, analyze their pros and cons, and select the most promising algorithm.\n\nCode Requirements:\n* Completeness: You MUST provide a fully runnable script. Do not use ellipses (`...`), comments-as-placeholders, or unclosed structures.\n* Style: Ensure the code is syntactically perfect and strictly adheres to PEP 8 formatting.\n* Code review: doublecheck your code to make sure it will not bump into any runtime exceptions.\n* Response Format: You MUST respond in plain text, without wrapping the code into a Markdown codeblock.\n", "user": "# Current Program Information\n- Fitness: 0.0000\n- Feature coordinates: \n- Focus areas: -
